	<h4>About Cyber Security</h4>
	<p>

Cybersecurity issues are becoming a day-to-day struggle for businesses. Recent trends and cybersecurity statistics reveal a huge increase in hacked and breached data from sources that are increasingly common in the workplace, like mobile and IoT devices.

Additionally, recent security research suggests that most companies have unprotected data and poor cybersecurity practices in place, making them vulnerable to data loss. To successfully fight against malicious intent, itâ€™s imperative that companies make cybersecurity awareness, prevention and security best practices a part of their culture.</p>
